> gzip data compression from Swift, OS X & Linux ready

# Usage
Works on `Data` or anything [`Gzippable`](https://github.com/czechboy0/gzip/blob/master/Sources/gzip/gzip%2BData.swift#L42-46)

```swift
let myData = ... //Data
let myGzipCompressedData = try myData.gzipCompressed() //Data
...
let myGzipUncompressedData = try myGzipCompressedData.gzipUncompressed() //Data
... //PROFIT!
```

Middleware to suport gzipped content in `HTTPClient`.

```swift
let request = ... //Request
let response = try client.request(request, middleware: [GzipMiddleware()])
 ```
 
 Please note, that `GzipMiddleware` should be placed at the end of a chain:
 
```swift
let response = try client.request(request, middleware: [ContentNegotiationMiddleware(mediaTypes: [.json], mode: .client), GzipMiddleware()])
```

# Details

As this library uses a SwiftPM-compatible source of [zlib](https://github.com/Zewo/zlib), you don't need to install anything manually before using it. Even though both OS X and Linux have a preinstalled version of `zlib`, unfortunately each has a different version, making its potential use inconsistent. In our case everything is compiled from source, so you can be sure to get the same results everywhere. :100:

# Installation

## Swift Package Manager

```swift
