> gzip data compression from Swift, OS X & Linux ready

# Usage
Works on `NSData` and `C7.Data`, or anything [`Gzippable`](https://github.com/czechboy0/gzip/blob/master/Sources/gzip/gzip%2BNSData.swift#L42-46)

```swift
let myData = ... //NSData or C7.Data
let myGzipCompressedData = try myData.gzipCompressed() //NSData or C7.Data
...
let myGzipUncompressedData = try myGzipCompressedData.gzipUncompressed() //NSData or C7.Data
... //PROFIT!
```

Also contains a `GzipStream` class which conforms to `C7.ReceivingStream`, so it can be easily attached in a pipeline, like

```swift
let gzippedStream = ... //e.g. from S4.Body
let uncompressedStream = try GzipStream(rawStream: gzippedStream, mode: .uncompress)
... //PROFIT!
```

Also contains a `S4` compatible `Middleware`, which automatically adds the right headers to the request and decompresses the response if it's compressed.

```swift
let client = HTTPSClient.Client("https://my.server")
let response = client.get("/compressed", middleware: GzipMiddleware())
response.body.becomeBuffer() //<- Already decompressed data
```

# Details

As this library uses a SwiftPM-compatible source of [zlib](https://github.com/Zewo/zlib), you don't need to install anything manually before using it. Even though both OS X and Linux have a preinstalled version of `zlib`, unfortunately each has a different version, making its potential use inconsistent. In our case everything is compiled from source, so you can be sure to get the same results everywhere. :100:
